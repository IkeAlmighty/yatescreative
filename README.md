## About This Website

I made Yates Creative so that I would have a place to publicly record my thoughts, poems, and projects. The development of the website itself is an ongoing project. The following are some interesting struggles I have ran into (so far) during this process:

## Frontend CMS or Upload Markdown Files?

This question, for some reason, has really hung me up. Like most problems, I overthought it initially. Building your own frontend CMS is tempting, but ultimately a waste of time unless you are making money from people using it. Why? Because markdown rocks, and you can just type all your new posts in vscode with the handy ctrl + K + V markdown viewer.

That in mind, I did some research and found mdx loader for nextjs. It basically takes markdown files and converts them into full webpages in the app, using the file based routing system built into nextjs.

For my poetry however, I will continue to use a hand crafted on-site UI for typing things up, because I find that poetry is easier to post on the fly from my phone.

**_By the way, check out this this cheap, handy, and simple [bluetooth keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Arteck-Ultra-Slim-Bluetooth-Compatible-Including/dp/B07PFCRWG9/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Bluetooth+keyboard&qid=1657426974&sr=8-3) I use... no I'm not getting paid to advertise that, I just really have enjoyed this keyboard. It works flawlessly with my Pixel 4A._**
