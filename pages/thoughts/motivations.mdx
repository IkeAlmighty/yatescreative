# Motivations

I have been working ot become a developer, and between coding and applying to jobs, and reading feedback, and doing my best to apply that feedback, I have also been reading about burnout, motivation, and career building.

I have not give much thought about my intrinsic motivations to becoming a software developer, and how those motivations apply to my own values. I think in all careers it is important to examine how one's values relate to their career goals. Why? Three main reasons come to mind:

## Burnout

## The Dangers of Extrinsic Motivators

## Unavoidable Milestones

Goals need to align with values. If you work hard toward a milestone, but you don't really value the work put into getting there, you will be living a miserable life. I want to have fun!
