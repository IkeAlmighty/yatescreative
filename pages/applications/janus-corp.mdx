# Application for Web Developer

Janus Corporation

_Candidate:_ **Isaac Yates**  
_Interviewer:_ **Paul Chelstowski**

1. **Are you currently employed?**  
   yes, until August 21.

2. **Will you be able to devote 20 to 40 hours of your time weekly for Janus Corps?**  
   Yes, I will. I work 20 hours a week at my current job, and will be leaving that job on the week of august 21 as I work to transition to career in web development.

3. **Why do you think you'd be a valuable Web Developer for our company?**  
   Not only do I have strong communication skills from my years working as a barista, but upon looking at the Janus Corps website I am certain that there is much I could do to bring it up to date with 2022 web development practices.

4. **How do you prioritize tasks and organize your day as a Web Developer?**  
   I usually start each day by writing down and/or reviewing what needs to be done, and then from there I translate what I have written into git branches if branches need to be created for a feature, bug, hotfix, ect.

   From there I grab a cup of coffee and begin work on the tasks I have planned. When I reach a stopping point for the day, I commit my changes and push them to the web, and make sure to tick off all the tasks I've completed.

5. **Have you ever worked remotely?**  
   Yes, I have. I worked on a small startup project with one other coder called Askme Learning.

6. **What challenges do you think you'll face working remotely, and how will you deal with them?**  
   I have found that the number one challenge of remote work is communicating what needs done with my coworkers and supervisors. Often times Zoom meetings can go off task and not address the core issues at hand, which leads to a huge waste of time for all parties.

   I will face communication problems by outlining core issues before meetings happen, and keeping a structured project board on the cloud (such as Jira or Asana). I also like the idea of being available for drop-in Zoom conversations during pre-planned hours so that my coworkers can talk to me and work out more complex issues.

7. **How would you rate your tech skills?**  
   I would rate myself as a junior level developer as far as work experience goes, but I think that I have slightly more experience than the average junior applicant for several reasons:

   - I studied computer science for 3 years at the University of Oklahoma
   - I have been coding for myself, work, or school for 10 years.
   - I have a basic grasp of 5 different programming languages! (Java, C, C++, Javascript, & Python)

8. **How would you communicate with your remote team?**  
   I would communicate through the usual channels of video chat, github, and email.

   _How_ would I communicate?

   I am a big fan of Non-Violent Communication by Marshall B. Rosenberg. This communication style focuses on expressing validating others' feelings, and then clearly and respectfully expressing your own and stating your own needs. It's helped me with a lot of interpersonal conflict, and has also helped me to build deeper relationships with all the people in my life.

9. **How do you stay focused on your tasks?**  
   I stay focused through several means:

   - I set aside a physical space (such as a home office or coffee shop) that I do my work at. Repeated productivity in this space builds a habit so that I don't have to employ much self discipline to get into the zone.
   - I take medication for ADHD.
   - I drink coffee.
   - I keep a work computer and a play computer. My work computer runs linux and only has applications installed on it relating to work.
   - I make sure to write down a small to do list everyday before beginning my work so that I stay on task.

10. **What do you like and dislike about working in an office?**  
    I love that office environments allow me to communicate quickly with my coworkers when I have a problem. However, I have worked in offices that are very dull to look at. I dislike bad decor and enjoy listening to music while I work. Since gradeschool I have done most of my work in coffee shops, and so I feel more at ease in a place with background noise and things happening around me.

    Also, working from home allows me to save money on food and transportation.

11. **How do you switch off from work?**  
    I like to take a long bike ride or walk after work to unwind, and then I will likely play some video games on my play computer, or go out with some friends.

12. **Tell me about yourself and your last job**  
    I am an experienced craft coffee barista, love writing code, love writing poetry, and love creating cool things in general. My number one mission in life is to build deep and meaningful relationships.

    I value learning things deeply, exploration, and building a strong community for my friends and their children.

13. **How long would you expect to work for us if hired and how much will you request per hour if you are hired?**  
    I expect to work for at least 6 months, but hopefully 1 to 2 years! I am looking to build a strong foundation for a career in web development, and hopefully work in this industry for at least 10 years, if not more. The cool thing about web development is that every project is slightly different and fresh, and I can see myself keeping with this industry in some form or another for my entire life.

    As a junior developer, I expect to be paid around $55,000 a year _at a full time job_. For a part time job, I expect to make around $40 per hour.

14. **Where do you see yourself in five to ten years?**  
    In 5 years I see myself as an experienced mid level web developer, working a full time job and working on personal coding projects in my free time.

    In 10 years, I see myself possibly starting my own web development firm, or working on a successful SaaS startup.
