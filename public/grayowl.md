## **How familiar are you with Gray Owl? Why would you like to work here?**  
*The first shop I became a regular at, around 9 years ago, was Gray Owl Coffee. I studied for APUSH in high school at Gray, and didn’t understand what a mocha was, but loved drinking 2-3 of them on my own lunch money around 5:00pm each night. Sometime during those first years as a regular, my best friend’s parents bought Gray Owl. Avery asked me if I’d like to help paint the walls. I hopped on my bike and went to Gray and armed myself with one of the many paint rollers.*

*I remembered one person’s name that day, and his name was Andrew. Andrew is so freaking cool. He has this aura that is a mixture of ice cold coolness and dad jeans. Over the years, I learned everybody’s names, and y’all learned mine. Even though my coffee taste has evolved since high school, I still love to get a 12 oz mocha at Gray Owl. It reminds me of where all this love for coffee came from, and it tastes really sweet and delicious.*

*I would like to work for Gray because Gray has always worked so well for me. I did homework there, I watched movies there, I performed live music there… and I changed and found better versions of myself at Gray. In particular, when my (now) fiance broke up with me in 2019, I took my journal and some good relationship building books to the Owl, and painfully relearned how to express my emotions over the course of several months. Without a safe place to sit down and think and reflect, that never would have happened.*

## **What potential changes or dreams do you have for the future of Gray Owl?**  
*As well as a barista, I am also a full stack website developer. I would love to bring a personal touch to Gray Owl’s digital assets. However, I have no idea what the digital infrastructure of the coffee shop looks like. How does Gray Owl manage inventory? Digital punch cards? Can Gray Owl offer a digital art gallery in addition to its in-house gallery? Can the POS be replaced with something the team enjoys using more? What kind of online store could Gray manage? And how much of this can be automated in a way that does not make the customer base feel isolated?*

*My dreams are to help people find positive thoughts everyday, to build cool things, and to reach financial independence in my early 40s or late 30s and travel the planet.*

## **What strengths would you bring to the team?**  
*As I mentioned above, I can bring my tech skills to Gray Owl. I am not a social media guru, but I can provide my computer programming prowess to whoever is running that part of the team. Maybe that means getting the POS to communicate with Google Sheets, or maybe it means setting up an online store for reserving Cirque coffee beans for pickup by customers. Maybe it means helping the Gray Owl arts community reach an audience. There are as many possibilities as there are coffee beans on this planet.*

## **Are you interested in the path of becoming a worker-owner? Why or why not?**  
*I am interested! I’ve read that employee owned businesses grow faster and lead to higher overall happiness among the workers. I also think that wealth distribution is a large problem in our world, and would like to become part of the solution.*  
*In addition to all this, Gray Owl Coffee has been my 3rd place for almost a decade. I love Gray Owl and I love y’all who work there, and would like to more directly help us all grow.*

## **What are you passionate about?**
*I am passionate about creating cool things. This includes music, video games, board games, websites, and creative writing.*

## **List any relevant work experience here. Do you have any experience in food service or coffee specifically?**
*Since leaving college over 3 years ago, I have worked non-stop in craft coffee shops. They include:*  
    
 - Boxcar Coffee and Bikes
 - Theoryhouse Coffee and Juicery
 - Press and Plow Coffee
 - Coolbeans Coffee Kiosk
 - Yellowdog Coffee and Roastery

*I have spent the most time (almost all 3 years) at Boxcar Coffee and Bikes. The Boxcar community has been so caring and welcoming to me, but I need to move on to a place where I can grow more as a person.*

## **What is your scheduling availability?**
*It depends on the hours offered. If I can make enough to pay my bills y’all can have me any time of the week. Otherwise, I will have to juggle Boxcar hours with Gray Owl.*
