## **How familiar are you with Gray Owl? Why would you like to work here?**  
***The first shop** I became a regular at, around 9 years ago, was Gray Owl Coffee. I studied for AP U.S. History in high school at Gray, and didn’t understand what a mocha was, but loved drinking 2-3 of them on my own lunch money around 5:00pm each night. Sometime during those first years as a regular, my best friend’s parents bought Gray Owl. They asked me if I’d like to help paint the walls. I hopped on my bike and went to Gray and armed myself with one of the many paint rollers.*

*I met Andrew that day. Andrew is so freaking cool. He has this aura that is a mixture of ice cold coolness and dad jeans. Over the years, I learned everybody’s names, and y’all learned mine. In this way, I discovered that Andrew was not the only awesome person at Gray Owl. I've come back many times since and enjoyed coffee, and even though my taste has evolved since high school, I still love to get a 12 oz mocha at the Owl. It reminds me of where all this love for coffee came from, and it tastes really sweet and delicious.*

***I would like to work for Gray because** Gray has always worked so well for me. I did homework there, I watched movies there, I performed live music there… and I changed and found better versions of myself at Gray. In particular, when my (now) fiance broke up with me in 2019, I took my journal and some good relationship building books to the Owl, and painfully relearned how to express my emotions over the course of several months. Without a safe place to sit down and think and reflect, that never would have happened.*

## **What potential changes or dreams do you have for the future of Gray Owl?**  
***As well as a barista**, I am also a full stack website developer. I would love to positively change and grow Gray Owl’s digital assets, and I would love to automate the time consuming or boring parts of work. Could Gray Owl's inventory management be partially automated? Could coupons be texted to customers' phones as they walk in? Can Gray Owl offer a digital art gallery in addition to its in-house gallery? Can the point of sale system be replaced with something the team enjoys using more? Does it accept google or apple pay? What kind of online store could Gray manage?*

*I personally watched Avery struggle with the schedule at Gray Owl. Can the scheduling process benefit from automation? I will personally write software solutions to all of these problems, and do so in a way that does not isolate the customer base and upholds the spirit of the Owl.*

**The Dream**  
*Gray Owl has given me a place to grow my mind, my friendships, my heart, and it has given me a place to retreat to during dark times in my life, so that I could recover and become a better human. **My dream for the Owl** is to take the building blocks of that experience, improve upon them, and then give that improved experience to other people.*

## **What strengths would you bring to the team?**  
*As I mentioned above, **I can bring my tech skills to Gray Owl**. I can provide my computer programming prowess to the entire team, so that y'all can focus less on the tedious parts of your work and more on what you love. Maybe that means getting the POS to communicate with Google Sheets, or maybe it means setting up an online store for reserving coffee beans for pickup by customers. Maybe it means helping the Gray Owl arts community reach an audience. There are as many possibilities as there are coffee beans on this planet.*

## **Are you interested in the path of becoming a worker-owner? Why or why not?**  
*I am interested! I’ve read that employee owned businesses grow faster and lead to higher overall happiness among the workers. I also think that wealth distribution is a large problem in our world, and would like to become part of the solution.*  
*In addition to all this, Gray Owl Coffee has been my 3rd place for almost a decade. I love Gray Owl and I love y’all who work there, and would like to more directly help us all grow.*

## **What are you passionate about?**
*I am passionate about creating cool things. This includes music, video games, board games, websites, creative writing, and coffee.*

## **List any relevant work experience here. Do you have any experience in food service or coffee specifically?**
*Since leaving college over 3 years ago, I have worked non-stop in craft coffee shops. They include:*  
    
 - Boxcar Coffee and Bikes
 - Theoryhouse Coffee and Juicery
 - Press and Plow Coffee
 - Coolbeans Coffee Kiosk
 - Yellowdog Coffee and Roastery

*I have spent the most time (almost all 3 years) at Boxcar Coffee and Bikes. The Boxcar community has been so caring and welcoming to me, but I need to move on to a place where I can grow more as a person.*

## **What is your scheduling availability?**
*All week, anytime.*
